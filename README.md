# Automatic Visual Inspection System for PCB Defect Detection using YOLOv11s

This project implements an **Automatic Visual Inspection (AVI) System** for detecting surface-level defects on **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)** using the **YOLOv11s** object detection model. The system was developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP) under Faculty of Electrical Engineering under UiTM Pulau Pinang.

## üìå Overview
The proposed system integrates deep learning-based visual inspection with real-time decision output to classify PCB defects into six major categories:
- Missing Hole  
- Mouse Bite  
- Open Circuit  
- Short Circuit  
- Spur  
- Spurious Copper

The trained YOLOv11s model performs real-time inference using a consumer-grade PC and communicates results to an **ESP32 microcontroller** via serial UART for status indicatior.
